## 10 RESILIENCE
## 10回弹
Resilience is more than just recovering quickly from pressure. To be resilient is to be able to take “bitter circumstance in stride” and still “get the job done.” It might cost more or not be done as well had less (intentional or unintentional) adversity been present, but it will be done. Resilience is a superset of fault tolerance—and very much related to autonomic computing notions of self- healing, self-configuring, self-organizing and self-protecting.[^25]  [^26]弹性更比压力刚刚复苏迅速。是有弹性的，能够采取“痛苦的情况在大步”，仍然“把工作做好。”这可能会导致更多或不能这样做，以及有较少（有意或无意）逆境中一直存在，但它会做。弹性是容错，以及一个超集有很大关系自我修复，自我配置，自我组织和自我保护的自主计算概念。[^25]: Fault tolerance traditionally addresses system internal faults caused by a bug, hardware failure, or some kinds of internal error states. Resilience has a bigger scope in that it focuses on harmful elements external to the system, often introduced by an adversary, that tend to be unpredictable and unforeseen by the system’s designers.[^26]: Sometimes called self-optimizing (as part of self-CHOP), but optimization is often too strong a concept— we will accept suboptimal but improved capabilities as part of recovery.No other institutions are more involved directly in bitter or adversarial circumstances than the military. No other institutions have a greater dependence on resilience of its organizations and operations to survive and to succeed. Therefore, the current thinking of the military on resilience and the lessons they have learned in the past will inform us on how to better effect resilience within Industrial Internet Systems.没有其他机构更苦的还是对抗性的情况比军队直接参与。没有其他机构对其组织和业务应变能力的更大依赖生存和成功。因此，军事上的韧性目前的想法和经验教训，他们已经学会了过去将告诉我们如何更好地在工业网络系统作用的弹性。Military Command and Control (C2) has four main functions:军事指挥与控制（C2）有四个主要功能：Mission planning is either strategic (what resources and programs need to be in place to handle expected major events in the long term), or tactical (what resource can be deployed in response to an event that is expected to occur, and what is the overall impact if the resource is diverted from other tasks). Generally, tactical planning is done by units like ships or battalions and by units at higher levels such as a carrier group or a division) for larger engagements. Tactical planning focuses on a set of objectives such as the enemy’s next moves and planning for those that pose the deadliest threat. For IISs, this is the difference between how we plan to fail (create systems 590 that are robust to expected kinds of failures and have sufficient resources to recover), and how we enable recovery (create subsystems that are aware of their own performance and can adjusthow they operate, particularly in light of their peers.)任务规划或者是战略（哪些资源和程序必须到位，以处理从长远来看，预期的重大事件），或战术（有什么资源可以被部署在响应，预计将发生的事件，什么是整体冲击，如果资源是从其它任务转移）。一般情况下，战术规划是由像船舶，营单位，由单位在较高的水平完成，如较大的订婚载体组或部门）。战术规划的重点是一组目标，例如敌人的下一步行动和规划对于那些构成了致命的威胁。对于IISS，这是我们计划失败（创建系统590是稳健的预期各种故障，并有足够的资源来恢复），以及我们如何能恢复（创建子系统都知道自己的表现并能之间的差异调整他们是如何运作，尤其是在光他们的同龄人。）Situation awareness is knowing what needs to be known about a situation in relation to thetactical plan. Situation understanding is the larger contextual picture: why things are as they are.态势感知是知道哪些需要知道的战术计划的情况有关。了解情况是更大的背景画面：为什么事情是因为它们。Resource Management balances competing interests and concerns. It balances resources between threats that are current and imminent and those that are future and potential. For an IIS, it addresses questions such as how much computational resource to expend against detecting a security incursion vs. increasing replication of a service to assure that some copy will be able to compute a needed result in time.资源管理平衡相互冲突的利益和关切。它平衡和威胁是当前和即将发生的那些未来和潜在的资源。为IIS，它解决了如多少计算资源花费针对检测安全侵入与增加的服务的复制，以确保一些拷贝将能够在时间上计算所需结果的问题。Decide and Assess is the execution arm and the part that measures what has been done. If one sets out to neutralize an enemy emplacement, places the order and completes an air strike on the target, the next question is whether it has in fact been neutralized. This of course has implications for next steps, which could be further targeting or determining the target is too hardened and change the plan. For an IIS, there will be a constant balance of trying to decide if the current result is ‘good enough’ or if additional resources need to be expended to improve it (such as additional sensor readings to reduce uncertainty, confirmation dialogues to reduce risk of unintended action), or suggesting an in-service part be scrapped after a minor failure as it is more likely to trigger a major failure.决定和评估是在执行臂和用来测量做了什么的部分。如果一个人下决心压制敌人的炮台，下订单并完成对目标的空袭，接下来的问题是，它是否实际上已被瓦解。这当然具有用于下一步骤的影响，这可进一步靶向或确定目标太硬化和改变计划。对于IIS，将有试图确定一个恒定的平衡，如果目前的结果是“足够好”，或者更多的资源需要花费来改善它（例如额外的传感器读数，以减少不确定性，确认对话，以降低风险意想不到的动作），或建议的服务中的一部分轻微故障后报废，因为它更容易引发重大故障。The military generally sorts responsibilities into administration, intelligence, operations, logistics, and communications, all under a common commanding officer. These groups may be replicated at several levels of command, so there may be division level intelligence as well as battalion level(or fleet vs. ship).军方通常排序责任纳入管理，情报，作战，后勤和通信，都在一个共同的指挥官。这些团体可以在几个层次指挥被复制，所以有可能是正处级的情报，以及营职（或车队与船）。Military orders between levels of command have a specific syntax, including a number of sections that must be addressed, but the most important aspect for resilience is the notion of commander’s intent.[^27] This is used as part of the mission planning process where the commander sets up what the mission is about. The commander’s intent is important to resilience when used operationally, as it enables an isolated unit at any level devoid of communication to still have a chance of knowing what to do even if the extant plan fails.指挥级别之间的军令有一个特定的语法，包括一些必须解决的部分，但对于适应能力最重要的方面就是指挥官的意图的概念。[^27]这是用来作为任务规划过程，其中的一部分指挥官设立的使命是什么。指挥官的意图是很重要的韧性作战使用时，因为它使一个孤立的单元，在任何层面缺乏沟通还是有知道即使现存的计划失败，该怎么做的机会。[^27]: Of particular importance, “what are the N most likely things the adversary may do?” “What are the M most dangerous things they may do?” Planning generally has to address all of these contingencies, the longer one has for planning, the larger N and M can be—which means that the unit can be ready for a wider variety of unfolding circumstances.>Example: For instance, if all we have is the order to neutralize hill 73, then we must continue until hill 73 is neutralized or we run out of men. If we instead know that we are told this in the context of getting a clear shot at bunker AAA which is blocked by hill 73, then an unit which is (temporarily) under independent command can look at alternatives; perhaps all that is needed is to suppress the enemy or divert them on hill 73 to give the unit the opportunity to take the shot on AAA. So commander’s intent pushes decision making down to the level that is best able (in terms of having the best information at the best time) to make the decision. Then when the mission is completed, the unit can attempt to reintegrate, report what they did while out of contact and allow the plans to be changed to address the new situation.>示例：例如，如果我们所有的是为了中和山73，那么我们就必须继续下去，直到山73中和或我们跑出的人。如果不是知道我们在得到一个明确的射击掩体AAA这是阻止山73的情况下告诉本报，那么单位是（暂时）独立的指挥下，可以看一下替代品;或许所有需要的就是压制敌人或改变他们在山上73给单元拍到了AAA级的拍摄。因此，指挥官的意图推动决策下来，是最能水平（中具有最好的时机的最佳信息方面）做出决定。然后，当任务完成后，该单位可以尝试重新整合，报告他们做了什么，而失去联系，并允许计划更改为应对新形势。This approach handles uncertainty and failures of communication within ‘decide and assess,’ which is probably the most time-sensitive part of command-and-control. When executed well, there is a tremendous amount of flexibility and local negotiation possible even with ‘disconnected’ units to ‘get the job done.’[^28]这种方法在处理“决定和评估，”这可能是指挥和控制的时间最敏感的部分不确定性和通信故障。如果进行顺利的话，有弹性和地方的谈判可能产生巨大量甚至与“断开”单位“把工作做好。”[^28]: The exact amount depends on the service—marines have a lot more doctrinal flexibility than army units do for instance.Establishing a global information grid (a military cloud) to provide information to the frontline commanders wherever they were has proved to have unintended consequences. For example,providing this information has offered a way to run battles directly from the command headquarters, overriding intermediate command. The military has moved in the other direction in recent years partly because such remote control of battle hurts resiliency. Similarly, moving industrial control to the “cloud” may also hurt resilience—not only does the network itself create an attack surface and a point of failure, but the information available at the scene will always be greater than that which can compressed into the pipe. For resilience, we should instead think of how to improve local decision-making through network services—without introducing new dependencies such as using the cloud for higher-level management and perhaps permission, but not low-level control.建立一个全球信息网格（军事云）将信息提供给前线指挥官无论他们是已被证明产生意想不到的后果。例如，提供此信息提供了一种方法来直接从司令部运行的战役，覆盖中级指挥。军方已移动到另一个方向，近年来部分原因是这样的战斗遥控伤害弹性。同样，移动工业控制的“云”的可能伤害复原力不仅网络本身创建的一个攻面和一个故障点，但信息可在现场将总是大于它可以压制成的管。对于弹性，我们应该将思考如何提高地方决策通过网络服务，而不会引入新的相关性，如使用云更高层次的管理，也许权限，而不是低级别的控制。Here then is a list of lessons we can learn from the military C2 structure and doctrine:那么，这是教训，我们可以从军事C2结构和理论学习的列表：Expect to be disconnected from authority. Mechanisms must be in place to allow the mission to succeed, so some level of decision making on the edge is a requirement.预计从权威断开。机制必须到位，以使特派团成功，所以决策上的优势一定程度上是一个要求。In an IIS, control elements for critical operations must not be dependent on network availability.在IIS中，非常重要的操作控制元件必须不依赖于网络的可用性。Good decisions are not made in a vacuum. Communicate commander’s intent so that units in the field understand show their actions fit the bigger picture. The ability to alter plans locally provides a lot more flexibility and resiliency.良好的决策不是在真空中进行。沟通指挥官的意图，使单位在现场了解展现自己的行为符合大局观。在本地修改计划的能力提供了更大的灵活性和弹性。The implication for IISs is that local control elements must know more than just their own part of the plan. They must have a bigger picture of what they are responsible for that allows them to reconfigure their operation and maintain mission-level performance when under stress.其含义为IISs，是本地控制元件必须知道的不仅仅是他们自己的计划的一部分。他们必须对他们负责，让他们重新配置他们的运行和在压力下保持时，任务级别的性能一个更大的图片。Peer-to-peer communication is more important than hierarchical communication. Changing plans and developing new tasks requires the disconnected units to engage in all parts of command- and-control jointly with their neighbors so they can jointly succeed within the constraints of the commander’s intent. Once that intent (and an initial plan based on the strategically available resources) is communicated, little more needs to be said from higher chain of command until the mission is completed.点对点通信是比分层通信更重要。改变计划，并开发新的任务，需要断开连接的单位从事命令 - 与控制的各个部分共同与他们的邻居，使他们能够共同指挥官的意图的限制范围内取得成功。一旦意图（以及基于战略上的可用资源的初步计划）沟通，多一点需要从更高的指挥链可以说，直到任务完成。In IISs, this suggests that components must be autonomous, and able to act independently based on the plan and information from other independently operating components nearby.在IISs，这表明组件必须是自主的，并且能够根据从附近的其他独立操作部件的计划，并在独立采取行动。Take advantage of the hierarchical network to optimize all parts of command-and-control. Do not use the connectivity, when available, to centralize decision making but distribute information to ensure that whole network becomes aware of changes to local plans so they can get an early start on changing too.采取分层网络的优势，优化指挥和控制的所有地区。不要使用连接可用时，集中决策，但分发信息，以确保整个网络的意识到改变当地的计划，以便他们能够尽早开始就改变了。In IISs, this suggests that components must be aware of the behavior of other components.在IISs，这表明组件都必须知道其他组件的行为的。Build a system that does not need the network to work—it only needs it to optimize. This is a given in the ‘fog of war.’构建不需要网络中工作，只需要它来优化系统。这是在给定的“战争迷雾”。In IISs, this partly follows from being able to run disconnected. However, some functions such as safety, should never be compromised just because of a network failure.在IISs，这在某种程度上遵循从能够运行断开。然而，一些功能，如安全性，绝不应仅仅因为网络故障损害。Delegate authority but not responsibility. Delegate sufficient authority to the agents to get the tasks done, but assume full responsibility to ensure the tasks are done right.In IISs, mechanisms must be in place to find the right function for the job, and to validate that it did what it said it would do. It is important, for example, that orchestration elements not just suggest a process, but also suggest how the process can be validated and monitored.下放权力，但不承担责任。委派足够的权力给代理商拿到的任务完成，但请自行承担全部责任，确保任务完成的权利。
在IISs，机制必须到位，以找到合适的函数的工作，以验证它做什么它说，它会做。这一点很重要，例如，该业务流程的元素不只是提供一个过程，但也建议如何过程可以验证和监控。Data without context can never become information. Pushing data around without context is not actionable. Context is hard to transmit as most context is the unwritten aspect of the circumstances and how the data was collected. Again this points to the criticality of ‘man on the spot’ processing—local to where the context actually is, enabling new techniques like learning to discover local phenomena that can help the particular instance of the problem being solved (rather than the much harder problem of inducing broad general rules).没有上下文数据就永远不能成为信息。围绕推进数据没有上下文是不可诉的。上下文很难传播，因为大多数情况下是情节不成文的方面，以及如何收集数据。同样，这点到'人当场“处理本地到上下文实际上是，支持新技术，如学习，发现当地的现象，可以帮助问题的特定实例的重要性得到解决（而不是更难的问题诱导广泛的一般规则）。
Plans do not survive first contact with the enemy. Many plans are reworked every time we learn something new. To have a plan is not to have a set of instructions for every situation but to ensure training is in place to handle every conceivable contingency. Battles will always be dynamic, what endures is the ability to see patterns, react quickly and get inside the enemy’s OODA loop. [^29]计划没有生存与敌人第一次接触。许多计划被改写每次我们学到新的东西的时间。有一个计划是不是有一组对每一种情况的说明，但是，以确保培训到位，处理每一个可以想象的偶然性。战斗永远是动态的，什么等外是看模式，迅速作出反应，并得到了敌人的OODA循环中的能力。[^29]: “Observe, Orient, Decide, Act” Col. Boyd’s brilliant insight into how fighter pilots operate. If one can execute one’s OODA loop faster than the adversary can, they will usually win the battle because they can react to unfolding circumstances and in fact create unsettling circumstances faster than the adversary can. (This has also been applied to business management).Control systems observe (by reading sensors), decide (using a comparator) and act (using actuators). There is no ‘orient’ function. In IISs, a resilient control architecture must be able to notice and discover when it is in an unexpected situation (i.e. orient itself), and then work to get itself back into a reasonable operating band, with the cooperation and collaboration of its peers.控制系统的观察（通过读取传感器），决定（使用比较器）和行为（使用驱动器）。有没有“定向”功能。在IISS，弹性控制架构必须能够看到和发现的时候它是在一个意想不到的情况下（即东方本身），然后努力让自己回到一个合理的工作频段，与同行的合作与协作。Plan and Prepare. Current military thinking tries to go beyond ‘react and respond.’ This goes back to mission planning. We must both plan to fail and enable recovery. We must also capture the lessons learned to aid future recovery. Recovery of prior operational capacity can mean changes to tactics, techniques and procedure (‘doctrine’). That is how the organization learns rather than just individuals.筹划。目前的军事思想试图超越“的反应和应对。”这又回到了任务规划。我们必须同时计划失败，使恢复。我们还必须捕捉到的经验教训，以帮助未来的复苏。恢复之前的业务能力就意味着改变战术，技术和程序（“教义”）。这是怎样的组织学习，而不仅仅是个人。In IISs, analytics can detect both imminent failure of a component, but also circumstances extant across a fleet of components when a component failed. This enables global learning.Upward communication is often more important than downward. Mechanisms must be in place to communicate knowledge up the chain of command based on actual incidents, including what has been tried and failed.在IISs，分析可以检测组件的两个即将发生的故障，而且情况在整个组件的舰队现存当一个组件失败。这使得全球学习。
上行通信往往比向下更重要。机制必须到位，以传播知识了命令基于已经发生的事故，包括哪些已经尝试和失败的链。In IISs, we have to ensure the kinds of properties driven down to the autonomous edge devices are policies rather than plans. That is, they include advice about how to make choices in difficult situations, rather than specific courses of action. The implication of this is that edge devices are dependent on having appropriate computational elements for the complexity of the kinds of ‘reactive plans’ they are expected to implement.[^30]在IISs，我们必须确保种驱动下到自主边缘设备属性是政策，而不是计划。也就是说，他们的建议包括关于如何做出选择在困难的情况下，而不是行动的具体课程。这个含义是，边缘设备依赖于具有用于种，他们有望实现“无规划”的复杂性，适当的计算元素。[^30]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_planningI was just following orders. This is never a legitimate excuse in the military.我只是奉命行事。这是从来没有在军事上合法的借口。In IISs, each component to the extent possible must make sure it does not violate local safety doctrine, even if it means ignoring direct orders from chain of command.[^31]The ‘unit on the spot’ is on the spot both in the physical and legal sense.在IISs，每个组件尽可能必须确保它不违反当地安全学说，即使这意味着从指挥链无视直接下单。“当场单位的是无论是在现场物理和法律意识。There is a chain of command. Communications between units must be validated before they are trusted. Obey no commands even if they are issued by a higher-level officer unless they are established in that unit’s chain of command. Trust is established before it is needed, and is necessarily hard to change with very formal procedures in place for transfer between commands.有一个指挥链。他们是值得信赖的前部之间的通信必须经过验证。服从即使它们由更高级别的人员发出，除非它们被建立命令的那个单元的链没有命令。建立信任是需要在它之前，是必然难有非常正式的程序，以改变地方的命令之间的传输。Similarly IISs components should be inherently distrustful of ‘changes of ownership,’ ‘newdoctrine,’ or even out-of-cycle updates; it is important that they are mechanisms not only for verifying they come from a trusted source, but that they make sense now.同样IISS成分应该是内在的不信任“新学说”所有权的变化“，”甚至超出了周期更新;重要的是，它们不仅用于验证它们来自可靠源的机制，但它们是有意义了。[^31]: Other doctrine, such as security, privacy, etc. may come into play as well, but safety is the most important as it is the hardest to recover from.
