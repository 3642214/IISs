## 11 INTEGRABILITY, INTEROPERABILITY AND COMPOSABILITY##11 可积性，互操作性和可组合性IISs are assembled from many components from multiple vendors and organizations within avendor. To be assembled into large systems, these multifarious components must demonstrate:[^32]IISS是从供应商的多个厂商和组织的许多部件组装而成。组装成较大的系统中，这些繁杂的部件必须证明：[^32]: This model is based on Page et al: Toward a Family of Maturity Models for the Simulation Interconnection Problem [29]* integrability—the capability to communicate with each other based on compatible means of signaling and protocols,* interoperability—the capability to exchange information with each other based on common conceptual models and interpretation of information in context and* composability—the capability of a component to interact with any other component in a recombinant fashion to satisfy requirements based on the expectation of the behaviors of the interacting parties.* 积-能力基于信令和协议兼容装置相互通信，
* 互操作性的能力基于共同的概念模型，并在上下文中解释的信息，并与彼此交换信息
* 组分的组合性-的能力与任何其他组分相互作用在重组的方式，以满足基于所述交互方的行为的期望要求。Composability relies on and adds to interoperability and integrability. Integrated components may have a capacity to communicate with each other but there is no guarantee that they can exchange information correctly, let alone whether they would have the intuitively expected behavior. Interoperable components can exchange information correctly but there is no guarantee their behavior is predictable. To look at this in another way: if an integrable component is replaced with another integrable component, the system may stop functioning; if an interoperable component is replaced, the system may behave quite differently; if a composable component is replaced with another with similar specifications, the system behaves in the same way.组合性依赖，并增加了互操作性和可积性。集成的组件可能有能力与对方沟通，但也不能保证他们能正确地交换信息，更遑论他们是否有直观的预期行为。可互操作的组件能够正确地交换信息，但并不能保证他们的行为是可以预测的。看看这个以另一种方式：如果一个积组件替换为另一个积组件，系统可能会停止运作;如果一个可互操作的部件被更换，系统的行为将完全不同;如果一个组合的组件被替换为另一个具有类似规格，系统行为中的方式相同。>Example: Two people are integrable if both are able to speak and listen; interoperable if they speak the same language; and composable if they share similar culture and educational background and can collaborate for specific tasks.>例子：两个人都积如果两者都可以说和听;可互操作的，如果他们说同一种语言;如果他们有着相似的文化和教育背景，可以为特定的任务协作组合的。>Consider a person as a potential pilot in an airplane cockpit. The person is considered integrable with the airplane cockpit if she fits well in the seat, can view the front horizon, see the instrument readings and indicators, and reach to all the controls—this includes any physically fitting adult. The same person is interoperable with the cockpit if she understands the meaning of the instruments and the intended outcome of the controls—this includes any physically fitting enthusiast about piloting. The same person is composable with the airplane cockpit if she is trained for the model of the airplane so that she understands the meaning of the instruments in context and the behavior of the airplane when she exercises control over it. One appropriately trained pilot can replace another in operating a plane.>考虑一个人在飞机驾驶舱内的潜在试点。此人被认为是积与飞机驾驶舱，如果她非常适合在座椅上，可以看到前方地平线上，看到仪表读数和指标，并达到所有的控制，这包括身体上的任何配件成人。同样的人是可互操作的驾驶舱，如果她懂乐器的含义和控制，这样的预期成果包括关于试行任何物理拟合爱好者。同样的人是可组合与飞机驾驶舱，如果她被训练的飞机的模型，这样她理解上下文中的工具的意义和飞机的行为，当她在它行使控制权。一个受过适当训练的飞行员可以在操作平面取代另一个。IISs are large in scale and constructed from many types of components that are each evolving at an increasingly rapid pace. Components will change from being automatic (working by themselves with little or no direct human control) to autonomous (having the freedom to act independently) and they will need to be able to self-assemble. Integrability and interoperability are inadequate to meet the needs of such systems. We also need composability.IISs规模大，并从多种类型的组件，这些组件分别在不断发展的步伐越来越快建造。组件将来自被自动（本身很少或没有直接人力控制的工作）来自主改变（具有自由独立行动），他们将需要能够自组装。积性和互操作性不足以满足这样的系统的需求。我们还需要组合性。Human interaction and communication using natural languages has proven to be a robust and dynamic method for composability. This is evident from observing how well two strangers can communicate on the spot, with minimal preparation for integration and interoperation, and how well they form groups collaborating to complete large tasks (or gossiping on Facebook).人的交互和使用自然语言的通信已被证明是一个强大的和动态的方法可组合。这是从观察有多好两个陌生人可以当场沟通，与集成和互操作，以及他们如何形成团体合作，以完成大任务（或闲聊Facebook上）最少的准备明显。Willingly or not, component designers have different models of reality with different constraints and assumptions. Lacking telepathy or shared memory between designers of different components means models, constraints and assumptions are not easily communicated or shared. It is therefore difficult to support the higher levels of communications and interactions beyond the level of integrability.自愿与否，组件设计有不同的模型与现实不同的约束和假设。不同的组件设计师之间缺乏心灵感应或共享存储装置模型，约束和假设是不容易沟通和共享。因此它是难以支持更高级别的通信和相互作用的超越积的水平。Facing this challenge, we impose a mental framework for undertaking integrability,interoperability, and composability as different levels of communication or interaction, similar to that taken in Conceptual Interoperability [13], an idea grounded in simulation theory—how to make different parts of a simulation system interoperate.[^33]面对这一挑战，我们施加心理框架进行积性，互操作性和可组合为不同层次的沟通和互动，类似的概念互操作性考虑[13]，在模拟理论知识接地的想法，使不同的部位仿真系统互操作。[^33]: The considerations here are similar to those studied under linguistics and the philosophy of language— to ask how it is possible for humans to communicate, for us to know someone else’s meaning, and how we can learn new things without actually experiencing them through language, by, for example reading a book.We treat each communication in terms of passing messages containing symbols, similar in concept to natural language. (We will use natural language for examples.) The manner of communication supporting integrability in messages is well understood, so we focus on interoperability and composability.我们把在通过包含符号，在概念上自然语言类似的消息方面各通信。 （我们将使用自然语言的例子。）沟通，信息支持可积的方式是很好理解的，所以我们专注于互操作性和可组合性。At the base level, we have vocabulary and syntax—grammar—rules on legal word order and the relationship to meaning. For example, “car race” and “race car” both use the same words, and the meanings of the words themselves to do not change, but the thing that is denoted by the two examples, which differ only in their syntax, is different. Syntax can be fixed, as they are for the order of entries in a form, or variable as they are in a sentence where grammar is expressed as a set of rules.在基础层面，我们有词汇和法律语序语法语法规则和关系的意义。例如，“汽车比赛”和“赛车”都使用相同的话，的话，自己不会改变，但表示为两个例子，只能在自己的语法，不同事物的含义，不同的是。语法可以是固定的，因为它们是条目的一个形式，或变量的顺序，因为它们是在一个句子，其中语法被表示为一组规则。The next level up is semantics—the meaning of the words themselves. In most languages, each word can have more than one sense, which is taken up by context. For example, “Safety” has one meaning in an industrial setting and another in football; we would not expect a safety engineer to worry about a defensive strategy in a game. Typically, in systems design we try to have each symbol have a unique context-free meaning, but this can also lead to excessive verbosity as well as inflexibility.
上一级是文字本身语义的含义。在大多数语言中，每个字可以有一个以上的意义，这是采取了由上下文。例如，“安全”具有一个涵义在工业环境中，另一个在足球;我们不希望一个安全工程师担心在比赛中的防守策略。通常，在系统的设计，我们尝试有每个符号有一个唯一的上下文无关的意思，但是这也可能导致过度的详细程度以及不灵活性。Database schemas tend to express the semantics of items in the structure of records, and these can be used as a kind of translation between different systems. For example, one database may talk about ‘names’ while another may segregate ‘last name’ and ‘first name’ but the meaning of ‘last name’ is culturally dependent, so translating between the two may depend on the culture of the person being denoted. In one culture, the ‘last name’ is given; in another, it is that of the family.数据库模式倾向于表示项的语义中的记录的结构，并且这些可被用作一种不同的系统之间的翻译。例如，一个数据库可以谈“名”，而另一个则可能分离'姓'和'名字'，但'姓'的含义是文化相关的，因此两者之间的转换可能依赖于人的文化表示。在一种文化中，“姓”被定;在另一方面，它是系列。Therefore, to exchange information with natural languages, we need to share some basic vocabulary (how a word is interpreted in different contexts) and syntax in which the words can be arranged into structures. This semantic understanding in communication is the basis of interoperability.因此，要与自然语言交换信息，我们需要共享一些基本词汇（一个字如何解释在不同情况下）和语法，其中的话可以被布置成结构。这种语义理解沟通是互操作性的基础。Next, we have pragmatics, which is the meaning of a sentence in context. This generally depends on the conceptual model of the world. Pragmatics allows us to understand the import of an utterance on a particular occasion. In speech act [14] theory (how speech can be treated as a form of action), the base level is the ‘locution’ or what was actually said—the grunts in the utterance along with the syntax and semantics that are defined by the language (as opposed to the use in this instance). Above that is the ‘illocution’ or what the speaker intended to say: the pragmatics.[^34] The final layer is the ‘perlocution,’ which is the effect (intended or otherwise) on the other parties who hear the locution.接下来，我们有语用学，这是在上下文中的句子的意思。这一般取决于世界的概念模型。语用学让我们明白在特定的场合话语的进口。在言语行为[14]理论（如何语音可以被视为作用的一种形式），该基级是“惯用语”或什么实际说-的在发声呼噜声连同由所定义的语法和语义语言（相对于使用在这种情况下）。以上说的是'illocution“或说话者打算说：语用学.最后一层是”表达效果，“这是谁听到惯用语其他各方的影响（有意或以其他方式）。[^34]: Agent-based systems generally spill quite a bit of ink defining ‘performative’ speech acts (those that are performed by way of saying them, that is, when I say, “I promise you...,” I have done something, namely made a promise!). See, e.g., [31]So one way to think about communication is that we want to specify the illocution (what we intend to say) such that the perlocution (the effect on the listener) can be what we intend. (‘Can be’ rather than ‘will be’ because the speaker does not control the mental state of the listener, and the listener may not use the locution for the speaker’s intended purposes—let’s recall the ‘invented the internet’ meme among others.)所以要考虑通信的一种方法是，我们要指定illocution（我们打算说），使得表达效果（对听众的影响）可能是我们所想要的。 （“可以”而不是“将”，因为说话者不控制听者的精神状态，和听者可能不会使用惯用语的说话人的预期目的，让我们来回顾一下“发明了互联网”等等米姆。 ）Therefore, to exchange information with natural languages to achieve the intended effect, we need:因此，为了交换自然语言的信息，实现了预期的效果，我们需要：* to share a common or similar world knowledge (the understanding of the natural world and culture),* the conceptual model, to have the ability of comprehend the meaning in its context (locution and illocution) and* some general expectation of the other party in their understanding of the information (illocution) and their reaction (perlocution)—behavior.* 共享一个共同的或相似的世界的知识（对自然世界和文化的了解），
* 概念模型，以在其上下文（语言风格和illocution）理解含义的能力，
* 对方的信息（illocution）的理解和他们的反应（表达效果）-behavior一些普遍的期望。This pragmatic understanding is the basis for composability.这种务实的理解是基础，组合性。With this understanding of the different ways components can be assembled to form larger systems and how they are related to the different levels of understanding in communications, we can point to the places in this document where each of these elements are addressed:有了这样的认识的不同方式部件可以组装以形成更大的系统以及它们如何在通信相关的不同层次的理解，我们可以指出，其中这些元素的被寻址本文档中的地方：Levels of Communication | Levels of understanding in communication[^35] | Refer to

Table 11-1 Mapping of Levels of Communication to topics in this document表11-1映射通信量水平，本文件中的主题[^35]: The three levels of understanding in communication discussed here loosely map to the corresponding levels of interoperability as defined in the Conceptual Interoperability [13], i.e. technical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic understanding to technical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic interoperability, respectively. We use the term understanding in place of interoperability here to avoid the confusion that might be otherwise caused by also using the term interoperability in the levels of communication (integrability, interoperability and composability). However, phrases such as semantic interoperability will be used in other sections of this document.
