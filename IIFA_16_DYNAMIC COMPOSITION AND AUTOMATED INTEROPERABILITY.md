# 16 DYNAMIC COMPOSITION AND AUTOMATED INTEROPERABILITY
# 16 动态组合和自动互操作## 16.1 MOTIVATION## 16.1 动机IISs require secure, safe and scalable composition of many diverse components from a variety of sources, often with different protocols, to deliver reliable end-to-end services. Given that distributed Industrial Internet applications are intended to be responsive to dynamic environments and that related technologies and standards are rapidly evolving, resilient IISs need to adapt flexibly to optimize services as environments change and to avoid disruptions as components are updated, upgraded and replaced. IISs present new use-cases in distributed computing that will drive advances in information technology architecture.IISs需要多个不同的元件的从各种来源的安全，安全，可扩展的组合物，通常与不同的协议，以提供可靠的终端对终端的服务。鉴于分布式工业互联网应用旨在是响应于动态环境，并且相关技术和标准是迅速发展的，弹性IISS需要适应灵活优化服务环境的变化，并避免作为组件被更新，升级和替换中断。IISS提出了新的用例，分布式计算，将推动信息技术架构的进步。Service Orientation defines a logical framework for thinking about exchanging capabilities and data via distributed services and the ability to compose services into high-order applications and business processes. Though implementations vary and evolve, in general practice, service compositions are models of statically connected components. The relationships between components are defined in advance. At run-time, “orchestration engines” merely execute the composition. The method of composition design do not provide for any adaptation in response to change in the environment or of the components themselves. This tight coupling makes the compositions brittle; change requires manual redesign and generation of a new model or else the service is likely to break. The approach is not scalable in dynamic IIS environments. Advance testing of such service compositions can only validate the model in a controlled environment thatis not representative of real-world operations. 
面向服务定义想着通过分布式服务和服务组合成高阶应用和业务流程的能力，交流能力和数据的逻辑框架。虽然实现改变和演进，在一般的做法，服务组合是静态连接的组件模型。组件之间的关系是预先定义的。在运行时，“编制引擎”仅仅执行的成分。组合物设计的方法不提供任何适应于响应于组件本身的环境或改变。这种紧密的耦合使该组合物变脆;改变需要手动重新设计的新模式的产生，否则该服务很可能会打破。这种方法是不可扩展的动态IIS环境。这样的服务的组合物的预先测试可以只验证模型中的受控环境是不能代表真实世界的操作。
IISs require a flexible method of composing services, so components can be dynamically integrated at run-time to enable adaptable services. Instead of static point-to-point connections, the demands of IISs need semantic interoperability to support many-to-many connections. In this approach, compositions indirectly link components using metadata references to a domain information model. Compositions represent a set of references to the information model, rather than a fixed set of named components. By separating the model from the implementation, semantic service compositions support metadata-driven policy-controlled orchestration that interprets references at run-time to dynamically discover components and their connections, as well as their transport and transformation details and integrate them on-demand. This loosely coupled approach automates interoperability and enables policy-based optimization for flexible and dynamic IISs that can adapt to change and re-configure network resources accordingly. Since semantically composed services have abstract contracts that are dynamically translated to concrete implementations, simulations can demonstrate the impact of real-time change and provide an execution trace that can be validated.IISs需要构成服务的灵活的方法，所以组件可以在运行时被动态地集成，以使适应服务。而不是静态的点对点连接，伦敦国际战略研究所的要求，需要语义互操作性，支持多到多的连接。在此方法中，组合物间接链接使用元数据引用的域信息模型组件。组合物代表了一组引用到信息模式，而不是一组固定的命名组件。通过分离从实施该模型，语义服务组合物支持元数据驱动的策略受控配器，它解释的引用，在运行时动态地发现的组件和它们的连接，以及它们的运输和转化的细节和它们的按需集成。这种松耦合方式自动互操作性，并实现基于策略的优化灵活，动态IISs能适应相应地改变和重新配置网络资源。因为语义由服务具有抽象的合同被动态地转换为具体的实现，模拟可以展示实时变化的影响，并提供一种执行跟踪可被验证。Many of these concepts were part of the original vision of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).[^43] In the early days of SOA, the software industry focused on static solutions that it could bring to market quickly to satisfy pressing business demand for distributed computing. While dynamic features were perhaps ahead of their time, IISs now clearly require ‘smart’, adaptable composite applications. The demands of IIS drive change in several areas:许多这些概念是面向服务的架构（SOA）的原始愿景的一部分。在SOA的早期，软件产业主要集中于静态的解决方案，它可以带来快速推向市场，以满足迫切的业务需求分布式计算。虽然动态特征是可能超前了，IISs现在显然需要'聪明'，适应性强的复合应用程序。在若干领域IIS推动变革的要求：[^43]: Using OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) to Integrate Web Services (2002) [20] and New OASIS Committee Organizes to Provide Semantic Foundation for SOA (2005) [21]Situational awareness: Static solutions do not provide mechanisms for resolving possible incompatible assumptions about, for example, the operating environment, the deploymentcontext, the interacting entities, and so on.情景意识：静态的解决方案不提供机制解决有关，例如，在操作环境中，部署方面，交互实体，等等可能不相容的假设。Workload diversity: Static compositions cannot change their stripes. In the real world, an end-to- end process may be a collaboration, choreography or orchestration with elements of various levels of autonomy. Many responses may be taking place simultaneously and would require flexible compositions in response to event.工作负荷的多样性：静态组合物不能改变他们的条纹。在现实世界中，一个端到端的过程可能是一个协作，编排或流程与各种级别的自主元素。许多反应可能同时发生，并需要灵活组合以响应事件。Complex relationships: In IISs any element may have peer, parent and child relationships and thus varying roles and perspectives. This applies recursively to the participating elements, which may represent complex systems and involve a network of sub-systems. In a static solution, as tightly coupled complexity goes up, resilience goes down.复杂的关系：在IISs的任何元素可能有同行，父子关系，因此不同的角色和观点。这个递归适用于参与的元素，其可以表示复杂的系统，并且涉及子系统的网络。在一个静态的解决方案，紧密耦合的复杂性上升，韧性下降。Dynamic relationships: In IISs relationships are constantly forming and un-forming, as in a ‘friend- of-a-friend network’. The dynamics are changing constantly, creating on-the-fly activity and changing state among collaborating components. A self-forming composition may come into being when there is value in coordination, and then disengage or be uninvited from the group as events unfold. 
动态关系：在IISs的关系都在不断形成和未形成，如在'的一个朋友的网络朋友 - “。在动态的不断变化，创造的即时活动和不断变化的协作组件之间的状态。一种自形成组合物应运而生时，有协调的值，然后脱离或从组不请自来的事件展开。
In short, static, compartmentalized and centralized methods are not suited for dynamic optimization that concurrently satisfies multiple constraints for dynamic, diverse and distributed interactions expected in an IIS, and this prompts a shift from static models of integration and orchestration to “Dynamic Composition and Automated Interoperability.”总之，静态，条块和集中的方法不适合于动态优化该同时满足多个约束为预期在一个IIS动态的，不同的分布式交互，这提示从集成和编排到“动态组成和自动化的静态模型的移位互操作性。“## 16.2 CONSIDERATIONS## 16.2 考量Practices and standards established today may enable or constrain future capabilities, so any approach must provide enduring value, and delay the need for expensive and time-consuming re-evaluation and re-design of the architecture.今天惯例和标准，可以允许或限制未来的能力，因此任何方法必须提供持久的价值，并推迟了对昂贵和费时的重新评估和重新设计的体系结构。By separating models from implementation, dynamic composition and automatedinteroperability supports a future-proofed IIS architecture that accommodates change by design (i.e. integration decisions are postponed to run-time to allow for optimization and adaptation).通过从实施动态组合和自动化的互操作性分离模式支持适应变化设计一个面向未来的IIS架构（即集成决定推迟到了运行的时间，以便优化和调整）。We compose loosely coupled components using metadata references, contained in an information model that captures logical models of services based on abstract contracts. The abstract contracts de-couple system capability and control from the details of the implementation and infrastructure complexity. Consequently, the system capabilities can be declaratively described in the form of policy to bring about the desired service, function, conditions, and so on, without having to understand low-level implementation details.我们撰写使用元数据的引用，包含在信息模型捕获基于抽象的合同服务的逻辑模型松散耦合的组件。抽象合同解除情侣系统功能，从实施和基础设施的复杂性的细节控制。因此，该系统的能力，可以声明在政策的形式描述带来所期望的服务，功能，条件，等等，而不必了解低层次的实现细节。Since the abstract contracts do not explicitly define the implementation, they need to be interpreted at run-time by an agent that acts as an intermediary responding to events. Every event is an opportunity for an agent to add value, not just to perform a static script, but to discover patterns, perform functions, run analytics and otherwise ‘reason’.由于抽象合同没有明确定义的实施，就需要在运行时由该充当中介响应事件的试剂来解释。每一个事件是一个机会，一个代理来增加价值，而不仅仅是进行静态脚本，但要发现模式，执行功能，运行分析和否则“理由”。Agents resolve all references to find-and-bind the right resources just-in-time by performing all necessary connections and transformations, and to provide an optimal, context-enhanced response. Moreover, these agents monitor the responses of the employed services to ascertain if they are, in fact, responsive in accordance to the contract and otherwise replace the underperforming services to achieve the desired end-goal.代理解决所有引用查找和绑定通过执行所有必需的连接和转换正确的资源只是在时间，并提供最佳的，情境增强的响应。此外，这些试剂监测所采用的服务的响应，以确定它们是否实际上，响应根据该合同和否则取代不佳服务，以实现所需的最终目标。To maintain Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE), applications in an IIS may require visibility to the state of the interacting elements and network resources so it can observe and react to changes in connectivity and faults. This requires information be aggregated and translated into a common abstraction so system management applications can respond to events with any necessary re-configuration of the infrastructure and service implementation. The same high-level abstraction supports change at the application level, with the same QoS and QoE implications, to provide for sustainability of the end-to-end business capability.为了保持服务质量（QoS）和用户体验质量（QoE）的质量，在一个IIS应用程序可能需要的可视性，交互元素和网络资源的状态，以便观察和应对变化的连通性和故障。这需要的信息进行汇总，并转换成通用的抽象使系统管理应用程序可以使用的基础设施和服务实施任何必要的重新配置，以响应事件。同样的高层次的抽象支持更改在应用层，具有相同的QoS和QoE的影响，以提供终端到终端的业务能力的可持续性。In short, dynamic composition and automated interoperability must allow for real-time, data-driven, policy-controlled integration of services, and systematically late-bound at run-time, rather than integrating them in advance at design-time.总之，动态组合和自动化的互操作必须允许实时，数据驱动的，策略控制服务的整合，以及系统后期绑定在运行时，而不是将它们在设计时融合提前。This approach for IISs, as a natural advancement in the evolution of system composition and service orchestration, has other significant benefits:[^44]
这种做法对IISs，作为系统的组成和服务协调发展的一个自然的进程，还有其他显著的好处：
